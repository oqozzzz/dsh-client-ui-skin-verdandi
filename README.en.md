## Features

- Deep crimson `#8E2438` identifies navigation, identity, and selected conversations; bridal white keeps reading and editing areas clean; soft gold is reserved for knight crests and interaction details.
- Styles the sidebar, conversation header, chat history, composer, statistics dock, trace view, details pane, settings dialogs, and terminal hosts.
- Incorporates Verdandi motifs including the vow namecard, bridal portrait, rings, Sacred Tree, Sequence Sword, barbecue, and chibi artwork.
- Uses separate light and dark workspace scenes. The character stage scales smoothly with conversation state and adapts to narrow windows, collapsed sidebars, and reduced-motion preferences.
- Keeps the scenic stage while a legibility guard protects text contrast: a bridal veil that only drops when a transcript is present, plus a paper slip behind every process-metadata row and every new-session workspace chip (system prompt, turn failure, process control, turn-tail clock and actions, workspace / preset / branch chips). Worst-case ink ratios are ≥5.3:1 in both palettes.
- Presentation only: the plugin registers no service, does not read or modify model requests, and uploads no data.

## Installation

Verdandi ships in two forms; pick one for your setup. **Do not enable both at the same time** — they load the same visuals through different mechanisms, and enabling both stacks their rendering.

### Option 1: skin marketplace (recommended)

For dsh `0.1.7-rc.2+` setups with the skin center installed. The skin center is [`@linxin666/dsh-client-ui-skin-center`](https://github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-skins) (source at [zhu1090093659/dsh-skins](https://github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-skins), shipped with the dsh-web bundle) — it provides the skin list / try-on / apply as a first-class settings section and is the single loader for all skins:

1. Open “Settings → 皮肤 (Skin)” and find “薇儿丹蒂 · 纯白圣誓 (Verdandi · White Vow)” in the skin list.
2. Click 试穿 (try on) for an instant, uncommitted preview; click 应用 (apply) to persist — the page refreshes itself.
3. The skin installs as a pure asset directory into the DSH home. **No install command, no restart** — reopening the skin card or refreshing the page picks it up.

The marketplace version (`1.0.x`) is independent of the npm plugin version (`0.1.x`); marketplace updates are also done by re-downloading there.

### Option 2: standalone plugin

For setups without the skin center ([`@linxin666/dsh-client-ui-skin-center`](https://github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-skins)), or if you prefer npm versioning and command-line updates.

Install from npm:

```powershell
# Web profile (browser)
dsh plugin --profile web add @hjbztlbr/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi

# Desktop profile (the official 0.2+ desktop app, which embeds the same web client)
dsh plugin --profile desktop add @hjbztlbr/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi
```

Or from GitHub:

```powershell
# Web profile (browser)
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Sddft97/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi

# Desktop profile (the official 0.2+ desktop app)
dsh plugin --profile desktop add github:Sddft97/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi
```

After installation, enable “Verdandi · White Vow” in the plugin/skin manager and press `Ctrl+F5` to force-refresh the page.

### Notes

- When one form is enabled, make sure the other stays disabled.
- Full skins modify many of the same host surfaces, so keep only one enabled at a time.

## Appearance modes

Choose Light, Dark, or Follow System under “Settings → General → Appearance” in DSH. If DSH is set to a fixed appearance, changing only the browser or operating-system theme will not override it.

## Update and uninstall

**Skin marketplace install**: update by re-downloading in the skin marketplace; uninstall from the skin list, or delete `skins/verdandi/` under the DSH home and refresh the page.

**Plugin install**:

```powershell
# Update
dsh plugin --profile web update @hjbztlbr/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi
dsh plugin --profile desktop update @hjbztlbr/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi

# Uninstall
dsh plugin --profile web remove @hjbztlbr/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi
dsh plugin --profile desktop remove @hjbztlbr/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi
```

## Compatibility

- Tested with the DeepSeek Harness `0.1.5-rc.1` and `0.1.7-rc.2` Web profiles and the `0.2.0-rc.2` Windows desktop shell. 0.2 rebuilt the pane structure (the `data-pane` attributes are gone, replaced by slot wrappers), the sidebar navigation and the settings-dialog mount point; the skin probes both shell generations and stays backward-compatible, so 0.1.x behaviour is unchanged. On 0.1.7 both the skin-center `1.0.2` asset form (hooks trusted) and the plugin form were verified: 0.1.7 rebuilt the session header (`conversation.header`), the trigger rows, the user-echo clock row, the context notice rows, the work-steps fold and the turn-process ribbon. All are handled, and the older shell renders unchanged.
- 0.2 adaptation details: the plugin-manager and automation-task panels carry their own panel mark (scenic backdrop, heavier veil, ink tokens — deliberately no scroll clipping), so wheel scrolling keeps working after panel swaps; and the character stage is reused across session switches as the same node, so the figures no longer reload or flash back from full size to their seated scale.
- The Windows desktop draws a 40 DIP system caption band (`data-windows-titlebar`); the skin's top ornaments automatically keep clear of it. Browser shells never carry the attribute and keep the original ornament shape.
- Uses scoped compatibility styles for better-sidebar, AionUI, SSH, Cordis, `.xterm`, and settings portals without replacing terminal ANSI colors or broad system tokens.
- Decorative avatars and character artwork are hidden at smaller viewport sizes so controls and text remain usable.
- A few 0.2 desktop issues remain open and tracked (the rightbar “Start” pages stay unskinned; transcript text can bleed through the band below the composer); see the [known-issues log](docs/known-issues-0.2.md) for the list (Simplified Chinese).

![Settings compatibility preview](preview/settings.png)

DSH is evolving quickly. If an upgrade causes selector or layout regressions, open an Issue with the DSH version, browser version, affected page, enabled plugin list, and a screenshot.

## Troubleshooting

### The skin is installed but nothing changes

Confirm that the plugin is enabled and other full skins are disabled, then press `Ctrl+F5`. If the problem remains, check the browser console for `__ModuleLoader__` or client-bundle loading errors.

### Buttons or text have poor contrast in Settings

Temporarily disable other plugins that replace global theme tokens. This skin applies compatibility rules only to known DSH host surfaces; include the list of enabled plugins when reporting a reproducible conflict.

### The dark background does not switch

Change the appearance in DSH itself. Browser dark-mode preferences take effect only when DSH is set to Follow System.

## Local development

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
dsh plugin --profile web add link:C:/absolute/path/to/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi
dsh plugin --profile desktop add link:C:/absolute/path/to/dsh-client-ui-skin-verdandi
```

The package follows the DSH skin-plugin structure: `cordis.patch.yml` registers the bundle row, `skin.json` provides skin metadata, and the client keeps a reversible `apply()` / `dispose()` contract. Runtime styles are scoped under `body[data-dsh-verdandi]`.
